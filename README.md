# Calendar

This is a calendar app I've created. It is free to use and manipulate in any way. The calendar is now in Swedish but is very easy to make into another language. 

The calendar comes with a events.json file. It is there to handle events in the calendar. Feel free to manipulate the JSON file as you want it in your application.
